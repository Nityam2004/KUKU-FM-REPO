Once upon a time, in a lush green forest nestled beside a winding river, lived a clever monkey. He made his home in a grand old mango tree that stood proudly at the riverbank. The monkey was cheerful and kind-hearted and spent his days leaping from branch to branch, enjoying the sweet fruits of his tree.

Not far away, in the calm waters of the river, lived a crocodile and his wife. The crocodile was strong and patient, often seen gliding through the water, catching fish, and basking under the warm sun. The monkey and the crocodile became friends, often talking across the riverbank as the days passed.

The monkey loved to share his mangoes with his new friend. “These mangoes are the sweetest in the whole forest,” said the monkey. The crocodile was delighted and visited the monkey every day, listening to his stories while enjoying the juicy fruit.

One day, the crocodile took a mango home for his wife. She was amazed by the taste and grew curious. “Where do these delicious fruits come from?” she asked.

The crocodile told her about his friend who lived in the mango tree. “He is kind and wise and shares these fruits with me,” he said. The crocodile's wife thought for a moment and said, “If he eats such sweet mangoes, his heart must be just as sweet!”

The crocodile was puzzled. “Why would you want his heart?” he asked. “It’s not right to harm someone who has shown kindness.”

But the crocodile's wife insisted. “Bring him to our home,” she said. “I would like to thank him myself.”

The crocodile felt torn but did not want to upset his wife. The next day, he went to the monkey and said, “Would you like to visit my home across the river? My wife wants to meet you.”

The monkey hesitated. “I cannot swim,” he said. “How will I cross the river?”

The crocodile smiled. “Climb on my back. I’ll carry you across safely.”

The monkey agreed, and soon they were floating across the calm waters. The crocodile seemed quiet, and the monkey asked, “Is everything alright?”

The crocodile looked away and replied, “There’s something I must tell you.”

The monkey grew curious. “What is it?”

The crocodile sighed. “My wife wants to eat your heart. She believes it must be sweet because you eat sweet mangoes.”

The monkey was shocked, but he remained calm. He thought quickly and said, “Oh no! Why didn’t you tell me earlier? I left my heart back in the mango tree!”

The crocodile was confused. “You left it there?”

“Yes,” the monkey said. “We monkeys keep our hearts safe when we travel. If you take me back, I can get it for you.”

The crocodile believed him and turned around. As they reached the riverbank, the monkey leapt off his back and ran up the tree.

From high above, the monkey called out, “You foolish crocodile! How can anyone live without a heart?”

The crocodile realized he had been tricked and felt ashamed. “I’m sorry,” he said. “You were kind, and I tried to betray you.”

The monkey replied, “Let this be a lesson. True friendship cannot grow where there is deceit.”

The crocodile swam away silently. The monkey continued to live happily in his mango tree, wiser than ever.

The story spread across the forest, and all the animals admired the monkey’s cleverness. They learned that kindness and wisdom could outwit even the most dangerous of situations.
