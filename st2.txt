The Lion and the Hare
Once upon a time, in a jungle, there was a lion. The animals of the jungle decided to send one animal each day to be the lion’s meal. The lion agreed not to hunt for animals himself.

Panchatantra Stories
One day, it was the hare’s turn. On the way to meet the lion, the hare saw a deep well and noticed his reflection in it. The clever hare got an idea. When he reached the lion, the lion was upset because the hare was very small.

Quick thinking, the hare told the lion that five hares were sent, but four of them were eaten by another lion. The lion got angry and asked the hare to take him to this other lion. The hare said that the other lion lived in a well.

The lion followed the hare to the well and looked inside. He saw his reflection but thought it was another lion. Without thinking, he jumped into the well to fight the “other lion” and ended up hurting himself.

The hare was very happy because he tricked the lion. From that day on, all the animals in the jungle lived happily without worrying about being the lion’s meal. The story teaches us that cleverness can sometimes help us solve problems and live peacefully.

The moral of the story is: “Clever thinking can overcome challenges. It shows us that sometimes intelligence and quick wit can lead to solutions that bring happiness and harmony to everyone.”
