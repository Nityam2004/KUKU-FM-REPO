The Monkey and the Crocodile – A Tale of Wit and Wisdom

On the edge of a wide, glistening river, shaded by the dense canopy of the forest, stood a towering jamun tree. Its thick trunk twisted like an old tale, and its branches stretched across the sky like open arms. Deep purple fruits hung in clusters, glowing like tiny treasures under the sun.

High among those branches lived a monkey named Kapi. Cheerful, clever, and full of life, Kapi spent his days leaping from branch to branch, munching on jamuns and enjoying the rustling songs of the forest. His days were simple but joyful, filled with birdsong, sunshine, and the sweet taste of his favorite fruit.

One hot afternoon, as the wind whispered over the river’s surface, a pair of eyes watched Kapi from below. A crocodile named Makar, large and leathery with a calm demeanor, was swimming near the bank. The glint of the jamuns had caught his attention first—but it was Kapi's laughter that made him stop and listen.

Kapi noticed the onlooker. “Well, well! A river traveler,” he called out. “Want a treat, friend?” Without waiting for a response, he plucked a jamun and tossed it down. Makar caught it effortlessly.

The taste was unlike anything he had known. “Delicious!” Makar exclaimed. “This fruit is extraordinary.”

Kapi beamed. “They say the best jamuns grow on the friendliest trees. I guess that makes me pretty friendly!” That made both of them laugh, and with that small gesture, a new friendship began.

Day by day, Makar swam up to the tree for a chat. Kapi would toss down jamuns, and Makar would tell him stories of the river’s secrets—of otters playing hide-and-seek, of turtles older than time, and of fish that sang songs at night.

Their conversations stretched from short greetings to long exchanges about life, dreams, and the mysterious ways of the world. Time seemed to slow down when they were together.

Kapi felt lucky. “Who would’ve thought a monkey and a crocodile could be such good friends?” he mused aloud one evening.

“Life surprises us in the best ways,” Makar agreed.

But elsewhere, life was stirring in a very different direction.

At home, on a sandy island in the river’s bend, Makar’s wife, Karni, grew curious. “You’ve been spending a lot of time near that tree lately,” she remarked. “What’s so interesting there?”

Makar told her about the monkey—his kindness, his stories, and the wonderful jamuns. He brought some fruits home for her to try. She tasted one and widened her eyes. “These are heavenly,” she said, savoring the flavor.

Her thoughts grew clever—and a bit too ambitious. “If a monkey eats such fine fruits every day, he must be very special indeed. Strong. Healthy. Imagine if we had him as a guest… or more.”

Makar tilted his head. “What do you mean, dear?”

Karni gave him a sly look. “Invite him over. Let’s learn more about him.”

Unsure but not suspicious, Makar nodded. The next morning, he swam to the tree, smiling wide. “Kapi! My wife’s been hearing all about you and wants to meet you. Why not come over? You’ll love our island—it’s peaceful, with the best view of the moonrise.”

Kapi clapped his hands. “I’ve never left this side of the river. Sounds exciting!” Without hesitation, he hopped onto Makar’s back.

As they crossed the calm waters, the river mirrored the clouds above. But something was off. Makar was silent. His tail, usually steady, twitched nervously. Kapi noticed. “You’re quieter than usual. Is everything alright?”

There was a long pause. Then, with a sigh, Makar spoke. “I must tell you something. My wife… she had another idea. She wanted to understand how you live so long and look so healthy. She thought perhaps your way of life holds secrets. I shouldn’t have invited you under false pretenses.”

Kapi stiffened. But instead of panicking, he stayed composed. “Ah,” he said slowly, “you should’ve told me. I would’ve come prepared.” Makar looked surprised.

“You see,” Kapi continued, “we monkeys have a habit. We don’t carry our most valuable things with us—like our heart, for example. We leave it back in our tree for safekeeping.”

Makar blinked. “Your heart?”

“Yes! Right in the hollow behind the third branch. It’s a monkey trick. I can go get it if you want,” Kapi said with a serious face. “I’d never visit someone’s home without a proper offering.”

Not knowing what else to believe, Makar turned around and swam back. As soon as they reached the riverbank, Kapi leapt to safety and raced up the tree.

From a high branch, he looked down at Makar and shook his head gently. “Dear friend,” he said, “who carries their heart around like a pebble? You tried to trick me, but I forgive you. Just don’t betray a friend again.”

Makar was speechless. Embarrassed. “You’re right,” he said. “And you’re wise. I didn’t deserve your trust.”

The two sat in silence for a moment, one on the tree and the other in the river.

Days passed. Kapi stayed cautious, and Makar returned to his side of the river. But something had changed—not just in their friendship, but in Makar’s heart. He began to understand what true respect meant.

One evening, under a sky lit with gold, Makar returned to the tree—not to deceive, but to apologize. “I’ve thought a lot, Kapi. And I’ve learned more from your wit than from all my days in the river. I hope we can still share stories.”

Kapi smiled. “So long as they’re honest ones.”

They didn’t go back to being best friends. But they nodded to each other from afar. Respect replaced closeness, and wisdom replaced trust.

The story of the monkey and the crocodile spread through the jungle. Birds chirped it to their chicks. Deer told it to their fawns. Even the winds carried whispers of it to the far corners of the forest.

And its lesson stayed alive:
A clever mind is the best shield, and a friendship without trust is like a tree without roots.

 Moral of the Story:
True friendship is built on trust. Clever thinking and calm decisions can save you even in the trickiest of situations.
